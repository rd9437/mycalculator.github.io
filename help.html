    <h1>Simple Calculator by Rudransh Das</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Calculator Display:</strong> The large input field at the top of the calculator is where you can see and input numbers and mathematical expressions.</p>

    <p><strong>Numeric Buttons (0-9):</strong> You can click on the buttons labeled 0 through 9 to input numbers into the display. For example, clicking "7" will add the digit 7 to the display.</p>

    <p><strong>Basic Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /):</strong> The buttons labeled "+", "-", "*", and "/" are used for basic arithmetic operations. Clicking one of these buttons will add the corresponding operator to your input. For instance, clicking "+" will input the addition operator.</p>

    <p><strong>Decimal Point (.):</strong> You can use the "." button to add a decimal point for decimal numbers. For example, you can input 3.14 by clicking "3", ".", "1", and "4".</p>

    <p><strong>Clear Button:</strong> The "Clear" button resets the calculator, clearing the display and allowing you to start a new calculation.</p>

  <p> <strong>Delete Button:</strong> The "Delete" button removes the last character from your input. If you make a mistake, you can click this button to correct it one character at a time.</p>

  <p><strong> Square Root (√):</strong> Clicking the "√" button calculates the square root of the number currently displayed. For example, if you have "25" in the display and click "√", it will show "5" because the square root of 25 is 5.</p>

  <p> <strong>Equals (=) Button:</strong> The "=" button computes the result of the mathematical expression you've entered and displays the answer in the input field.</p>

  <p><strong>Error Handling:</strong> If you input an invalid expression or perform a calculation that results in an error (like dividing by zero), the display will show "Error."</p>
