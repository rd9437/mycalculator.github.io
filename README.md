## About the Source Code

+ **HTML Structure:** The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the calculator interface using standard HTML elements such as div, input, and button. It also includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files.

+ **CSS Styling:** Inline CSS styles are used to style the calculator interface, including the layout, buttons, and display area. The styles define colors, dimensions, margins, and borders to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

+ **Calculator Interface:** The calculator interface consists of a display area (<input type="text">) to show the calculation result, numeric buttons (0 to 9), arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, *, /), and special function buttons (Clear, Delete, âˆš, .).

+ **JavaScript Logic:** Inline JavaScript code (<script>) is used to handle user interactions and perform calculations. Event listeners are attached to each button to execute corresponding functions when clicked. Functions are defined to append input characters to the display, clear the display, calculate the result, calculate square roots, delete the last input, and update the display.

+ **Error Handling:** Error handling is implemented to handle invalid input and mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero). If an error occurs during calculation, the display area shows "Error" to indicate the problem.

+ **Navigation Buttons:** The calculator interface includes navigation buttons (About Me and Help / Info) as links to external pages for additional information about the calculator and the creator.
